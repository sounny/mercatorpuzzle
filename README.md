# Mercator Puzzle Redux

Interactive version of Google's original Mercator Puzzle using [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) and vanilla JavaScript.

## About

The [original Mercator Puzzle](http://gmaps-samples.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/poly/puzzledrag.html) was static: the same 15 countries always appeared in the same positions. This version randomly selects 15 countries from a GeoJSON file and lets you drag them to their correct location. Doubleâ€‘click a country if you're unsure where it belongs.
